# Network-Intrusion-prediction-using-ML

In this problem we are going to train the machine learning model to give more accuracy for network intrusion detection system.

I have used training and testing dataset separately with me. run the CS.ipynb file in VS code or jupyter notebook, google colab, anaconda etc.
The trained machine learning model is using logistic regression algorithm that produces the accuracy of 99%.
